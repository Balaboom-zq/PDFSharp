[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Didstopia/PDFSharp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Didstopia/PDFSharp)

A .NET Standard 2.0 library for reading, writing and editing PDF files.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a modified fork based on several OSS projects. For more information see [Licenses](https://github.com/Didstopia/PDFSharp/blob/master/README.md#licenses) or [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/Didstopia/PDFSharp/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

## What works vs. doesn't work

- [x] Creating, modifying, loading and saving PDF documents
- [x] Loading custom fonts, drawing text on PDF documents
- [x] Encrypted (password protected) PDF documents ([#3](https://github.com/Didstopia/PDFSharp/issues/3))

It's important to note that this is **prerelease software**, meaning some things work while others do not.

If you come across a PDFSharp feature that you know should work (but doesn't), please submit an issue or pull request so we can slowly move towards a stable release.
